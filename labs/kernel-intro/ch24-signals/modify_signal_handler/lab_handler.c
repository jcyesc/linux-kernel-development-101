/*
 * Changing Signal Handlers for a Running Process.
 *
 * Suppose a running process has installed a signal handler and you
 * wish to switch it out on the fly, perhaps re-installing the default
 * handler for the signal.
 *
 * An example (which motivated this lab) is given in
 * http://jonebird.com/2007/06/21/stripping-another-process-of-its-signal-handler/,
 * where core dumps (SIGABRT) had been turned off and it was desired
 * to produce one.
 *
 * Write a module which takes as input parameters the process ID of
 * the process you want to interfere with, and the signal number which
 * you want to restore to its default behaviour.
 *
 * Try sending the signal before and after the module is installed and
 * note the difference.
 *
 * In order to do this you will need a short testing program which
 * installs a do-nothing signal handler function for the desired
 * signal.
 *
 * Note you will have to drill your way down from the task structure
 * to find out where the signal handler function is installed.  and
 * you wish to switch it out on the fly, perhaps re-installing the
 * default handler for the signal.
 *
 * It is also possible to accomplish this task completely from user
 * space by use of the LD_PRELOAD environmental variable to replace
 * signal handlers.  See man ld.so to see where to begin.
