/*
 * Mutex Contention
 *
 *
 * Write three simple modules where the second and third one use a
 * variable exported from the first one. The second and third one can
 * be identical; just give them different names.
 *
 * Hint: You can use KBUILD_MODNAME to print out the module name.
 *
 * You can implement this by making small modifications to your
 * results from the modules exercise.
 *
 * The exported variable should be a mutex. Have the first module
 * initialize it in the unlocked state.
 *
 * The second (third) module should attempt to lock the mutex and if
 * it is locked, either fail to load or hang until the mutex is
 * available; make sure you return the appropriate value from your
 * initialization function.
 *
 * Make sure you release the mutex in your cleanup function.
 *
 * Test by trying to load both modules simultaneously, and see if it
 * is possible. Make sure you can load one of the modules after the
 * other has been unloaded, to make sure you released the mutex
 * properly.
